# Local Weather
This is a FreeCodeCamp project that is taking the user location and shows the weather in that location. The user will find out what is the description of the weather, the humidity, chances of rain, wind, temperature and he will also be able to change the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsiuse.
In this project I have learned how to make an API call and also I have learned to use better HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## To start the project:

 * In order to receive the API data you need to obtain a key:

    - make an account on: https://openweathermap.org/api;
    - click API key;
    - give a name and click Generate;
    - install dotenv ```npm install --save dotenv```
    - create a new file .env in which you need to add a constant REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR KEY
    - import dotenv in index.js at top level


 * Install and start the app:

    - ```clone the repo```
    - ```cd into the folder```
    - ```run npm install```
    - ```npm start```
